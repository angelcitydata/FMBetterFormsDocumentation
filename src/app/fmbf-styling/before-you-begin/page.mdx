# Before You Begin

Before you can customize the styling of your BetterForms application, you need to apply the foundational code to your app environment. {{ className: 'lead' }}

---

## Required Setup

For any custom styling to work properly in your BetterForms application, you must first apply the code from both of these sections to your app environment:

### 1. DOM Header

The DOM Header code provides the structural foundation for your application's header area and must be applied to the **DOM Header** section of your BetterForms app environment.

➡️ **[View DOM Header Code](/fmbf-styling/dom-header)**

### 2. CSS

The CSS code includes all the custom properties (CSS variables) and base styles that power the theming system. This code must be applied to the **CSS** section of your BetterForms app environment.

➡️ **[View CSS Code](/fmbf-styling/css)**

---

## How to Apply

### Applying DOM Header Code

1. In your BetterForms app, click the **Settings** tab in the left sidebar
2. Click the **DOM Header Insertions** tab at the top of the page
3. Copy and paste the DOM Header code from the [DOM Header page](/fmbf-styling/dom-header)
4. Save your changes

### Applying CSS Code

1. In your BetterForms app, click the **Styling** tab in the left sidebar
2. Copy and paste the CSS code from the [CSS page](/fmbf-styling/css)
3. Save your changes

Once both sections are applied, all custom styling and theming will work correctly in your application.

## Important: Refresh Required

**App-level changes require a hard refresh to take effect.**

After applying the DOM Header and CSS code, you must perform a hard refresh on any active page previews you are currently viewing:

- **Windows/Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Shift + R` or `Shift + Reload Button`

This ensures that the browser clears its cache and loads the updated styles and header code.

## What's Next?

After applying the required code:

- **[DOM Header](/fmbf-styling/dom-header)** - Customize your application header
- **[CSS](/fmbf-styling/css)** - Modify theme colors, spacing, typography, and more
