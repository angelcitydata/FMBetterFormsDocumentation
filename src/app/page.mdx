# FMBetterForms Documentation

FMBetterForms is a cloud-based platform designed specifically for FileMaker developers. It provides a comprehensive framework with interactive UI components that enable you to build beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly web applications that integrate seamlessly with your FileMaker solutions. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## What is FMBetterForms?

FMBetterForms is a cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) platform designed to help FileMaker developers create modern, responsive web applications without requiring extensive knowledge of web technologies. It operates independently of FileMaker's Web Viewer technology and offers:

- **Pre-built Components**: Ready-to-use UI elements like buttons, inputs, dropdowns, and more
- **Modern Design**: Clean, professional styling with built-in animations and interactions
- **Easy Integration**: Simple JSON configuration or HTML-like syntax for rapid development
- **Consistent UX**: Standardized component behavior across your entire application
- **Responsive Design**: Components that work seamlessly across different screen sizes
- **Cloud Platform**: Hosted Platform as a Service (PaaS) environment with minimal installation requirements
- **FileMaker Integration**: Seamless integration with FileMaker's Data API and XML gateway

## Getting Started {{ anchor: false }}

FMBetterForms components can be used in two ways: as JSON configuration objects or as HTML-like `<bfcomp>` elements. Both approaches provide the same functionality, so you can choose what works best for your development workflow. {{ className: 'lead' }}

### Quick Example

Here's how you might create a simple button component:

<CodeGroup>
```html title="HTML Component Syntax"
<bfcomp name="Button" 
        label="Save Changes" 
        variant="primary" 
        icon="fa-floppy-disk" 
        namedAction="saveRecord">
</bfcomp>
```

```json title="JSON Configuration"
{
  "name": "Button",
  "label": "Save Changes",
  "variant": "primary",
  "icon": "fa-floppy-disk",
  "namedAction": "saveRecord"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Key Features

- **Named Actions**: Components trigger FileMaker script actions through the named action system
- **Loading States**: Built-in support for showing loading indicators during async operations
- **Icon Support**: Font Awesome icons integrated seamlessly with all components
- **Theme Integration**: Consistent styling that matches your application's design
- **State Management**: Components automatically handle disabled, loading, and interactive states
- **Model System**: Reactive data binding with app-level and page-level models for state management
- **Multi-Window Support**: Built-in support for complex applications with multiple windows and card windows
